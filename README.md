# Real-Time-Chat

This is a simple real time chat I was working on in class again, its pretty simple and not much too it (Again this is mostly made with ChatGPT since this is a new area of development I am learning which i can hopefully use for another project). It uses Socket.IO for live chat, Express.js for the server, MongoDB for storing chat history and user data, and JWT for user authentication.

## Features

- Real-time messaging with Socket.IO
- User authentication with JWT
- Chat history stored in MongoDB
